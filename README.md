The diagnostic AI model you created is designed to predict cancer diagnoses based on various patient data. It uses a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify whether a patient has cancer or not, making it a binary classification problem. The model is trained on a dataset that includes medical features such as tumor size, age, and genetic markers, excluding the diagnosis column, which serves as the target for prediction. The model employs binary cross-entropy as the loss function, ideal for binary classification tasks, and uses the Adam optimizer for efficient training. The sigmoid activation function in the output layer generates a probability between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis. This model provides valuable decision support in healthcare, helping professionals with early cancer detection and treatment planning by analyzing patient data more efficiently.
